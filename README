To run the application:
1. run docker-compose up --build
2. run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` within the docker container

To fetch the sample techlines and fields run `python manage.py fetch_data` within the docker container

You can add both Techlines and Fields via django-admin. 
Create a super user running `python manage.py createsuperuser` within the docker container, and use it to log into the admin panel.

Endpoints:
/api/v1/fields/{field_id} - Endpoint serving field data
/api/v1/fields/{field_id}/techlines - Endpoint serving field data with techlines

Note:
There is a known error of postgis databases container starting after the django app, ATM the workaround I propose is hot realoading the django applications (Ctr/Cmd + S in any .py file within the app)
In the future it can be fixed by the implementations of wait-for.sh script.
